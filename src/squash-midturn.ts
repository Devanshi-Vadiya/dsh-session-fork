/**
 * Mid-turn squash handoff: `/squash into <branch>` (and its RPC twin)
 * invoked while the source branch's agent is still running its turn.
 * @module dsh-session-fork/src/squash-midturn
 *
 * Design (agreed 2026-08-26):
 *
 * - **The running turn ends through the official cancellation path** —
 *   `agent.cancel(cause, { keepInbox: true })`. The log keeps only official
 *   shapes: a `turn/end` with an aborted reason, byte-identical in kind to
 *   a user interrupt. `keepInbox` guarantees queued mail survives the handoff
 *   (the preserved items are claimed by the follow-up turn).
 * - **The squash itself runs from a plugin-owned continuation** once the
 *   agent is quiescent (`agent.whenIdle()`), so `executeSquash` enters its
 *   vendored `runMaintenance` window legally and the checkpoint lands in
 *   the official idle-compaction form — identical to a between-turns
 *   `/squash`. The executor runs UNCHANGED.
 * - **The continuation reports back by opening a follow-up turn** on the
 *   source agent ("squash completed/failed: …") — the async-completion
 *   precedent of the official agent-teams tooling.
 * - **Unread-mail guard**: squashing while the inbox holds undelivered
 *   messages would summarize an incomplete picture (pending items are not
 *   on the surface yet). The handoff refuses instead. No artificial
 *   delivery trigger is needed: pending next-step items are claimed
 *   automatically at the running turn's next step boundary, so the refusal
 *   self-heals — read the mail, then squash again. Next-turn items
 *   legitimately wait for a turn boundary; the refusal text says so.
 * - **Precheck before the cancellation** (`precheckSquash`, `balance:
 *   false`): a bad target, self-squash, an unregistered source, or an
 *   empty region must never cost the source its turn. The
 *   boundary-pairing gates are deliberately NOT part of it — they are
 *   time-sensitive (the initiating call itself keeps the surface's final
 *   step open; go-ce-v3: `squash_into` on a running self was refused with
 *   "region end … the step is still open" and this handoff was
 *   unreachable). The executor re-validates on the post-cancellation
 *   idle surface, where the cancelled turn's `turn/end` closes the step.
 *
 * Pure over injected seams, mirroring the repo's cordis-free discipline:
 * the host shell in index.ts/rpc.ts wires `run` to its in-flight
 * bookkeeping so plugin disposal drains the continuation too.
